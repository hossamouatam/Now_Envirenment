# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attetion to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    # Filter top 5 skills for each job
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

    if i != len(job_titles)- 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    # Plot horizontal bar chart
    #df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_percent', ax=ax[i], title=job_title, legend=False)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
```

### Results
